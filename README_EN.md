EduWork is a desktop AI assistant built on [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). Choose a folder and describe what you want to accomplish: read sources, search for information, analyze data, and create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in one workspace.

Individuals can connect their own model APIs. Schools and businesses can configure their identity and model services. **Each client runs independently on its user's computer, with no separate EduWork server to deploy.**

### Start with a real task

| What you are working on | Try asking EduWork |
| --- | --- |
| Teaching and learning | “Create a presentation from these course materials, then make a quiz and revision flashcards.” |
| Research and discovery | “Read these sources, organize findings by topic, cite the evidence, and flag questions to verify.” |
| Data and everyday work | “Compare these spreadsheets, identify differences, and create an analysis report and summary table.” |

The agent can read and edit files, run scripts, and coordinate subagents for complex tasks. Conversations and outputs stay with your workspace, ready for revisions, new sources, and follow-up work.

### Make the results in Studio

Open Studio on the right and choose an output type, or ask for it in a conversation. Both entry points share generation, previews, and downloads.

**Reports · Spreadsheets · Presentations · Mind maps · Quizzes · Flashcards · Audio · Video**

![Studio sidebar: create teaching materials for a lesson plan, shown with an institution configuration](docs/images/studio.png)

<p align="center"><sub>The screenshot shows an institution configuration. Studio is part of the public edition; interface names and branding are configurable.</sub></p>

Export reports, spreadsheets, and presentations as **DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX** files. Preview interactive learning materials and download media with subtitles. Image generation and cloud TTS require compatible services; local speech depends on the system and local resources. See [media configuration](docs/MEDIA.md).

### Make it work your way

- **Search and browser**: use official DeepSeek search when its key is configured, or browser search without a key otherwise.
- **Skill center**: browse built-in skills, import skills, or write task guidance of your own without rebuilding the client.
- **Memory and mail**: keep task context with local memory; configure an email account to work with the mail assistant.
- **Speech, models, and preferences**: use local transcription and system speech synthesis, choose your models, switch between blue and red themes, and set a total limit for concurrent model requests.

![Skill center: browse and manage built-in skills, import skills, or create your own](docs/images/skills.png)

Skills provide task guidance; plugins provide executable capabilities. Supported identity, model, and media services connect through configuration.

</details>

## Installation and use

The current desktop target is **Windows x64**, distributed as a **portable Electron package**. Extract it to run. macOS support is being prepared; see the [macOS notes](docs/MACOS.md).

### 1. Get the client

Download a complete desktop package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ecnu/EduWork/releases), extract it into a writable directory, and run `EduWork-Electron.exe`. Keep the accompanying resource files; do not copy just the EXE.

If no desktop package is available in Releases yet, follow the [build guide](docs/BUILD.md) to run from source. GitHub's Source code archives are not desktop packages.

### 2. Connect a model

Open **Settings → Models** and enter your provider's API key, endpoint, and model. School and enterprise users can load an organization configuration as described below, then sign in through the browser to obtain models.

### 3. Start working

Choose a local workspace, add your task materials, and describe the result you want. For documents, spreadsheets, and other outputs, you can also open Studio on the right and choose an output type.

<details>
<summary>Window behavior and updates</summary>

Closing the window minimizes it to the system tray by default. Use the tray menu to exit completely. The Windows public edition defaults to GitHub updates, with public-beta and development channels selectable in Settings; institutions can configure another source. Updates preserve history and user configuration; see the [update guide](docs/UPDATES.md).

</details>

## School and enterprise integration

**Enterprise integration is built into the public edition.** Schools and businesses can distribute a configuration file that connects the same EduWork client to their identity platform, model gateway, and media services, without changing the public code or rebuilding the client.

### Servers supporting enterprise sign-in

| Server / project | Sign-in and model access | Setup and usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) | Sign in to the gateway and access models authorized for the user and selected team. | [LiteLLM setup guide](packages/dsh-oidc/docs/gateway-auth/litellm-setup.en.md) |
| [ChatECNU](https://developer.ecnu.edu.cn/vitepress/llm/model.html) | Sign in with a university account and access authorized models; the university extension provides personal quota information. | [EduWork@ECNU](https://github.com/ECNU/EduWork-ECNU) |

**East China Normal University users can use the university-distributed EduWork@ECNU, with school configuration already included: sign in to get started.** Distribution and usage instructions are maintained in the EduWork-ECNU repository.

Token model access in this table requires a build containing this feature; it is not yet in published npm packages or desktop releases. ChatECNU uses the explicitly enabled experimental oidc-llm adapter.

After enterprise sign-in, the client uses the login Token to discover and invoke models, refreshing it automatically during use. Users do not need to copy or create a separate model key. The server continues to manage model permissions and quotas; enterprise and personally configured models can coexist.

Other standard OIDC platforms can provide identity sign-in. Organization models additionally require a supported Token model-access contract. Organizations can also configure image generation, cloud TTS, names, logos, and update sources.

<a id="configuration-steps"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>Configure your organization in three steps</strong></summary>

1. Select **Open configuration file** in Settings to edit `config/eduwork.jsonc` in the client directory.
2. Choose a configuration example from the server guide above and add the organization to `organizations`; add `media` if image or speech services are needed. More examples are available in the client's `config/examples/` directory.
3. Save, exit completely through the tray, and restart. Then select your organization and sign in.

Configuration files contain public connection details and credential references. Manage personal API keys in model settings; login Tokens are kept in protected local storage. Do not put passwords or tokens in the configuration file. The interface logo is configurable; the embedded application icon comes from the distribution.

</details>

**Administrator configuration:** [LiteLLM example](config/desktop/examples/litellm.jsonc) · [Experimental oidc-llm example](config/desktop/examples/organization.jsonc) · [Media example](config/desktop/examples/media.jsonc).

**Developer integration:**

- [Server implementation and integration testing](packages/dsh-oidc/docs/server-integration-contract.en.md): endpoints, authentication requirements, and acceptance steps for the LiteLLM native and experimental oidc-llm contracts.
- [Client integration modes and model discovery](packages/dsh-oidc/docs/public-resource-protocol.en.md): identity-only and Token model modes, authorized catalogs, model capabilities, and plugin integration through the shared Host.

<a id="extend-internal-capabilities-through-plugins"></a>

### Add internal services with plugins

Schools and businesses can use plugins to connect internal systems, bringing organization-specific search, business tools, or account services into EduWork. Plugins provide executable capabilities; skills provide task-specific guidance. Existing identity, model, and media APIs should use configuration where supported.

Organizations can combine plugins, skills, and default configuration into their own edition while reusing EduWork's workbench, Studio, file previews, and desktop capabilities. Shared features continue to be maintained in the public edition, while each organization maintains its extensions.

[EduWork@ECNU](https://github.com/ecnu/EduWork-ECNU) is an example of an institutional extension, showing how East China Normal University connects its internal services to the public edition. Use that repository as a reference for organizing extensions and distribution configuration; see [edition boundaries](docs/EDITIONS.md) for the design.

## One integration, more clients

> **Let institutional accounts and model services work across more AI clients.**

Through the **Open Identity and Model Integration Initiative**, we invite identity platforms, model gateways, and client developers to make sign-in, model credentials, and model catalogs reusable through open protocols.

`dsh-oidc` is our starting implementation: standard OIDC identity sign-in, the LiteLLM native OAuth contract, and the experimental oidc-llm contract, sharing Token sessions and model invocation modules. Source, protocol documents, and configuration examples are public, and the module is maintained as an independent npm package. Other clients can implement the protocols without adopting EduWork's UI. This is a community proposal; interoperability needs version-specific testing.

**[Read the initiative](packages/dsh-oidc/docs/open-integration.en.md)** · [Implement a server](packages/dsh-oidc/docs/server-integration-contract.en.md) · [Integrate a client](packages/dsh-oidc/README_EN.md) · [Share feedback](https://github.com/ecnu/EduWork/issues)

## Data and privacy

Conversations, workspace references, and memory are managed locally. When using remote models, search, or media services, content needed for a task is sent to the corresponding provider and is subject to that provider's data policies.

When moving between computers, use [history import](docs/数据导入.md) in Settings to merge conversations and materials inside the client directory. Workspace files outside that directory must be copied separately. For troubleshooting, export a diagnostic ZIP and, for a particular conversation, a separate Session log. See the [user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md).
