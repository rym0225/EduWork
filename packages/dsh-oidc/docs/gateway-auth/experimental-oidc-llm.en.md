# Experimental oidc-llm integration

[简体中文](experimental-oidc-llm.md) | **English**

This branch provides an opt-in oidc-llm 0.1 adapter, disabled by default and not released. The protocol remains under review. This page describes implemented client behavior; it does not claim that the [complete draft](oidc-llm-draft.en.md) is finalized or that a server has passed acceptance.

## Configuration

Add this object to desktop `organizations` or plugin `profiles`. The server must publish the complete `oidc_llm` extension; ordinary OIDC metadata cannot implicitly enable model access.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "dsh-oidc/v1alpha1",
  "id": "example-models",
  "displayName": "Example model service",
  "auth": {
    "discoveryUrl": "https://models.example.org/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "expectedIssuer": "https://models.example.org",
    "experimentalOidcLlm": true,
    "clientId": "replace-with-public-client-id",
    "identityMode": "oidc"
  }
}
```

Select `identityMode` explicitly. Neither mode falls back to the other:

| Mode | Requested scopes | Identity validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oidc` | `openid profile offline_access llm:models:read llm:invoke`, with consent | Initial RS256 ID Token required; signature, issuer, aud/azp, nonce, time, optional at_hash and UserInfo subject are verified |
| `oauth` | `llm:profile llm:models:read llm:invoke` | Reads sub from the discovered UserInfo-shaped endpoint; does not claim OIDC authentication |

Only static public-client registration is implemented; no client secret is accepted. Register the actual IPv4 loopback callback `http://127.0.0.1:<random-port>/oauth/callback`. Dynamic registration remains future work.

When discovery declares `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported: true`, both successful and error authorization responses must include `iss` exactly matching the discovered `issuer`. A missing value produces `gateway_callback_issuer_missing`; repeated, empty or mismatched values produce `gateway_callback_issuer_invalid`. The client does not exchange the code. Ask the authentication service administrator to align discovery and callback behavior before starting a new sign-in. The desktop callback listener closes when the flow ends; refreshing an old callback URL cannot resume sign-in.

Production endpoints require HTTPS. An isolated experiment may reuse `allowInsecureDevelopment: true` and `insecureDevelopmentOrigin`, with a mandatory `expectedIssuer` pin. HTTP is restricted to loopback or that exact origin, never an entire private network. LiteLLM native retains its loopback-only exception.

## Shared implementation and limits

Both gateway adapters reuse discovery transport, Code+PKCE, browser/callbacks, the Host credential vault, single-flight refresh, model catalogs, the DSH Provider and streaming authorization isolation. The OIDC identity mode directly reuses the existing strict verifier. Standalone identity-only `oidc` remains supported. Legacy model Key Binding has been removed; see the [migration guide](../key-binding-protocol.en.md).

Access tokens stay opaque. Discovered `api_base` and UserInfo must share the resource origin; authentication endpoints only receive their designated credentials, without redirects. Changed configuration/discovery bindings cannot reuse old authorization. Token responses require actual scope, positive integer expiry and a refresh token; grants cannot expand or omit required connection permissions. The server's expiry is honored without enforcing the unagreed 15-minute proposal.

Refresh may omit an ID Token. If present, its original issuer, subject, audience, optional auth_time and nonce are checked. Failed validation after rotation revokes the new credentials and requires sign-in instead of continuing with a possibly consumed old refresh token. Temporary Token endpoint failures preserve still-valid authorization.

Catalogs retain shared conservative capability mapping: ID-only rows support text without inferred vision or reasoning. Optional draft model capability fields are not consumed yet; use reviewed provider configuration when needed.

Institution extensions can use the existing Host-only `modelResourceFetch(profileID, relativePath)`. Legacy connections use their managed model Key; experimental connections use the current authorized Access Token. Both reuse path restrictions, GET, bounded bodies and logout isolation. The public plugin makes no implicit quota request and adds no quota RPC/fields. Extensions must be installed explicitly; the server must define and enforce their authorization.

Logout stops local requests before submitting refresh-token revocation; 200 empty and JSON responses are accepted. Remote failure only produces a sanitized warning. A persistent revocation retry queue is not implemented, so that draft proposal is not claimed. Refresh-family revocation, remaining Access Token validity, scope enforcement and model filtering still require real-server acceptance.
