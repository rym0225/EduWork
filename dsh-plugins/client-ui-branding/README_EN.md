# Client branding and color themes

[简体中文](README.md)

A removable DSH client plugin using official Sidebar/hero slots and `theme.overrideTokens`. The public default is neutral EduWork blue; branding does not enable institution services.

```yaml
product:
  name: EduWork
  logoUrl: ''
  styleLabels:
    dsh: Blue
    ecnu-liwa: Red
visualStyle: ecnu-liwa
```

Logo URLs support same-origin paths, HTTP(S) and image data URLs, not arbitrary local file paths. Product identity is read from `composition.base.product` rather than stale user branding settings; `visualStyle` remains a user preference. Red is the default, while saved blue or red preferences remain in effect. Application icons stay red regardless of the interface theme. Existing namespace and style IDs remain for compatibility.

One global color setting applies across plugins. `src/theme.js` contains `COLOR_SCHEME_TOKENS` and `RED_TOKENS`; blue values may be null to inherit official tokens. The plugin reuses the official settings entry without replacing upstream theme management.

Build with `build-client.ps1 -Upstream <source> -DshLockPath <lock> -Output <directory>`. The script uses the locked source with a temporary extension under `packages/extensions` and cleans it afterward. Do not run competing builds against the same upstream workspace.
